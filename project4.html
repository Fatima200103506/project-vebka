Its former name was given due to the eponymous Ukrainian poet's period of exile in the area.[2] It is located on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and is the capital of the Mangystau Region.Aktau is known for its unique block address system. Almost no streets in Aktau have names; instead, addresses generally consist of three numbers: the district number (also known as micro-region/micro-district/block), the building number, and the apartment number. This is because Aktau was originally planned as a camp for the workers of the oil industry.
