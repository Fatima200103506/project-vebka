          <h1>Names</h1> 
          <p>The settlement was founded in 1830 as Akmola or Akmolinsky prikaz (Russian: Акмолинский приказ "prikaz [office] of Akmoly"). This name was possibly given after a local landmark—Akmola literally means "white grave" or "holy city" in Kazakh—although this theory is not universally accepted.[2] In 1832, it was granted town status and renamed Akmolinsk.[2] On 10 December 1997, the city replaced Almaty as the capital of Kazakhstan. On 6 May 1998, it was renamed to Astana, which means "capital city" in Kazakh.[22] On 20 March 2019, the capital was renamed from Astana to its current name Nur-Sultan in honor of the long-ruling Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, shortly after his resignation.[23][24] Nur-Sultan (нұр-сұлтан) can be read literally as "radiant sultan" in the Kazakh language.</p>

                Nur-Sultan is the second-coldest national capital in the world after Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, a position formerly held by Canada's capital, Ottawa, until Nur-Sultan attained capital city status in 1997.[43][44] Nur-Sultan has an extreme continental climate with warm summers (featuring occasional brief rain showers) and long, very cold, dry winters. Summer temperatures occasionally reach 35 °C (95 °F) while −30 to −35 °C (−22 to −31 °F) is not unusual between mid-December and early March. Typically, the city's river is frozen over between the second week of November and the beginning of April. Nur-Sultan has a well-deserved reputation among Kazakhs for its frequent high winds, the effects of which are felt particularly strongly on the fast-developing but relatively exposed Left Bank area of the city.

<p>The city transport in Nur-Sultan consists of buses and taxis.<br> Over 720,000 people use public transport daily.[95] There are over 40 bus lines served by more than 1000 vehicles, with over 3000 people working in the public transport sector.[96] Just like buses, share taxis have their own predefined routes and work on a shared basis. There are nine share taxi routes in total.

    Trolleybus routes were opened in 1983. There were originally 3 routes, however, by 2006, only one route was left. In 2008, the only trolleybus fleet by the special state commission was declared unprofitable due to debts to the energy supply company and as a result, it was completely closed.</p>
